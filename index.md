## Research Experience
**Image Captioning** | University of Manchester | Research Assistant       
Jun 2018 - Jul 2019   
**Advisor**: Tingting Mu, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science, University of Manchester
* Designed new loss function to serve as punishment to penalize general and ‘safe’ but non-discriminating captions of images and simultaneously improved the BLAU evaluation by 4%-7% compared with similar methods
* Designed new cyclic supervision algorithm in order to generate discriminative captions whose results were more distinguishing based on human evaluation
* Improved the training process of image captioning by calculating BLAU value among generating captions and captions in the dataset to find similar caption, which benefits for pushing descriptions of similar images away by certain distance


**Person Re-ID** | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | Research Assistant      
Dec 2017 - Jul 2019   
**Advisor**: Hongtao Lu, Professor, School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Did large quantities of experiments on how to use generated samples in the unsupervised learning framework and found that if average labels are given to the generated samples before putting them into training data, samples of lower quality counter-intuitively will improve the results of Re-ID more by 5%-7% on mAP (accuracy evaluation of Person Re-ID)
* Designed an unsupervised learning framework to improve the Rank1 accuracy of Person Re-ID by approximately 9%-11% compared with state-of-the-art methods by extracting disentangled latent features of images of pedestrians
* Implemented CycleGAN, PTGAN and PNGAN with pytorch to generate samples of various qualities


**EEG signal Analysis** | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | Researcher   
Sept 2017 - Aug 2018  
**Advisor**: Baoliang Lv, Professor, School of Computer Science, IEEE Fellow, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Combined attention model with sequential segmentation in EEG signal analysis to increase the accuracy of determining how long participants slept on average by 50% to 65%
* Utilized deep mutual learning method that combined several light RNN models to increase the accuracy of supervised learning framework to determine how many hours participants slept last night by 9%-11%


## Working Experience
**Pinpoint Fund** | Quantitive Researcher | Shanghai 
Apr 2022 - now
* **Machine learning multi-factor stock selection structure construction**: Built a multi-factor stock selection model pool based on Random Forest and Xgboost.
* **Stock selection strategy based on intraday data**: Built a series of daily frequency stock selection strategies that describe intraday minutes’ return distribution, volatility and jump stripping. The annualized return of long-short backtest performance reached more than 30% and the maximum drawdown was within 10% while annual sharpe ratio reached 2.5.

* **Stock selection strategy based on crossday data**: Built enhanced version of the reverse daily frequency stock selection strategy based on the daily frequency price volume and turnover rate data. The annual return rate of was 15%, the maximum retracement was 12% and the average annualized Sharpe was 1.2 in long-short backtest.

**Probability Investment Management Co., Ltd.** | Quantitive Researcher | Shanghai 
Jan 2021 - Mar 2022
* **Low-frequency factor back-test platform construction**：Implemented low-frequency factor backtest-related indicators based on Python, such as: selecting the calculation of factor return, ic/rankic, cumulative return, alpha return, turnover rate, style exposure, and industry exposure under the long-short grouping according to different modes.
* **Genetic Algorithm Factor Mining Project**：Used the genetic algorithm-based deap library for high-frequency or low-frequency factor mining, and designing different evaluation functions, mutation methods, and pruning and deduplication methods, the goal of searching for new factor combinations that provide alpha increments to existing factors is achieved.
* **Hedging effect of investment portfolios exploring**: Explored how to better predict the hedging effect of investment portfolios.


**Youtu Computer Vision Lab**, Tencent | Deep Learning and Computer Vision Intern |  Shanghai
Oct 2018 - May 2019
* Implemented state-of-the-art Human Key Points Detection model with Pytorch and combined it with Person ReID model then raised the recall rate of recognition on both business datasets (10,000 id with 250,000 images of person) by 6%-8%
* Combined Human Parsing and Foreground Mask with Person Re-ID to promote the performance of identification based on ‘mask guided attention’ thought.


**NSG Department, Intel** Shanghai | SSD Validation Intern
Jun 2017 - Dec 2017
* Was responsible for automation operation and maintenance of data center
* Wrote SSD test script using Python
* Used MATLAB and Python to analyze SSD business trend and sales
