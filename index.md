* Master in Computer Science specialized in __machine learning algorithms and practice__.

## Research Experience
**Image Captioning** | University of Manchester | Research Assistant       
Jun 2018 - Jul 2019   
**Advisor**: Tingting Mu, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science, University of Manchester
* Designed new loss function to serve as punishment to penalize general and ‘safe’ but non-discriminating captions of images and simultaneously improved the BLAU evaluation by 4%-7% compared with similar methods
* Designed new cyclic supervision algorithm in order to generate discriminative captions whose results were more distinguishing based on human evaluation
* Improved the training process of image captioning by calculating BLAU value among generating captions and captions in the dataset to find similar caption, which benefits for pushing descriptions of similar images away by certain distance


**Person Re-ID** | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | Research Assistant      
Dec 2017 - Jul 2019   
**Advisor**: Hongtao Lu, Professor, School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Did large quantities of experiments on how to use generated samples in the unsupervised learning framework and found that if average labels are given to the generated samples before putting them into training data, samples of lower quality counter-intuitively will improve the results of Re-ID more by 5%-7% on mAP (accuracy evaluation of Person Re-ID)
* Designed an unsupervised learning framework to improve the Rank1 accuracy of Person Re-ID by approximately 9%-11% compared with state-of-the-art methods by extracting disentangled latent features of images of pedestrians
* Implemented CycleGAN, PTGAN and PNGAN with pytorch to generate samples of various qualities


**EEG signal Analysis** | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | Researcher   
Sept 2017 - Aug 2018  
**Advisor**: Baoliang Lv, Professor, School of Computer Science, IEEE Fellow, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Combined attention model with sequential segmentation in EEG signal analysis to increase the accuracy of determining how long participants slept on average by 50% to 65%
* Utilized deep mutual learning method that combined several light RNN models to increase the accuracy of supervised learning framework to determine how many hours participants slept last night by 9%-11%


**Design Control Algorithm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle** | Shanghai Jiao Tong University | Researcher    
Feb 2016 - Nov 2017   
**Advisor**: Professor Xiangyang Zhu, Professor and Dean of Robotics Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Designed rapid detection of UAV failure state algorithm based on machine learning method to help the UAV react from failure within 25ms-40ms
* Obtained two invention patents in mini UAV framework designing and control system of micro UAV

## Working Experience
**Youtu Computer Vision Lab**, Tencent, Shanghai | Deep Learning and Computer Vision Intern     
Oct 2018 - May 2019
* Implemented state-of-the-art Human Key Points Detection model with Pytorch
* Raise the recall rate of Human Key Points Detection on both business datasets and open datasets by 15%


**NSG Department, Intel** Shanghai | SSD Validation Intern
Jun 2017 - Dec 2017
* Was responsible for automation operation and maintenance of data center
* Wrote SSD test script using Python
* Used MATLAB and Python to analyze SSD business trend and sales
